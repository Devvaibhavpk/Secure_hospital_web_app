## 1. Background & Motivation

Healthcare organizations often rely on legacy systems that, while operational, are fraught with vulnerabilities—exposing sensitive patient data and risking operational continuity. Transitioning to modern systems is difficult due to tight budgets, compliance requirements, expensive upskilling, and organizational inertia. Your project tackles this by offering a secure, cost-effective, and phased solution that protects patient care and data security while improving efficiency.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Data Classification & Access Management  
- **Sensitive vs. High-Sensitive Data**:  
  - *High-sensitive data* is exclusively accessible by admins, protected using server-side logic and secured endpoints.  
  - *Less sensitive data* (e.g., general patient records) can be accessed by doctors and nurses.  
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Admin access requires 2-step verification for an added layer of protection.

### 2.2 ROI & Risk Assessment Module  
Admins can input parameters related to:
- Legacy system deficiencies  
- Compliance issues  
- Security vulnerabilities  

The app calculates ROI, identifies “critical” and “high-risk” items, and helps prioritize remediation.

### 2.3 Modular Deployment for Cost Efficiency  
Instead of replacing legacy systems in one expensive overhaul, your app supports a phased, modular approach—reducing immediate capital outlay and enabling incremental modernization.

## 3. Architecture & Security Design

### 3.1 Data Flow Overview  
1. **Data Input**: Sample data is categorized into sensitive and high-sensitive tiers.  
2. **Access Control**:  
   - High-sensitive data stays within an isolated server environment, encrypted at rest and processed offline.  
   - Common data is synchronized to a cloud service (e.g., AWS S3) for accessibility and scalability.

### 3.2 Sensitive Data Handling  
By processing the most sensitive data on-premises—without exposing it over the internet—you significantly reduce exposure. The cloud handles less sensitive information to maintain availability and workflow efficiency.

### 3.3 Two-Step Authentication for Admin  
Admins must undergo a 2FA process (e.g., OTP or authenticator app) to access high-sensitivity interfaces and operations, strengthening trust and reducing unauthorized access.

---

## 4. Deployment

### 4.1 Modular Rollout Strategy  
1. Deploy core modules handling low-sensitivity data first (nurses, doctors).  
2. Integrate the ROI/risk module.  
3. Finally, deploy the high-sensitive data module with server-side protection and 2FA.

### 4.2 Infrastructure Overview  
- **Server**: Houses high-sensitive data and ROI engine; isolated from public internet.  
- **Cloud (e.g., AWS S3)**: Hosts less sensitive data for accessibility by clinical staff.  
- **2FA Service**: Can integrate with TOTP, SMS, or email-based systems for authentication security.

## 5. How It Works

### 5.1 User Roles & Permissions  
- **Admin**: Access to high-sensitivity data, 2FA, ROI/risk analytics, system controls.  
- **Doctor / Nurse**: Access only to non-sensitive data, clinical workflows.  
- **Security/Compliance Officer (optional)**: Can review risk reports and data classifications.

### 5.2 ROI & Risk Assessment Logic  
- Input parameters reflecting legacy vulnerabilities, compliance gaps, and pain points.  
- Visual or numerical outputs that categorize legacy components into “critical” or “high-risk,” guiding strategic upgrades.

## 6. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/Secure_hospital_web_app.git
cd Secure_hospital_web_app

# Install dependencies
npm install              # Or similar if using another stack

# Optional: Configure your environment
cp .env.example .env
# Update values: database, 2FA provider, storage paths, etc.

# Run the application
npm start                # Or run server, etc.
